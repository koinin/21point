# Comparative Analysis of AI Agents in Blackjack: A Study of Decision-Making Strategies

## 1. Introduction

Blackjack, a classic casino card game, has long served as an ideal testbed for studying decision-making algorithms and artificial intelligence strategies. This research explores the implementation and performance comparison of different AI agents in a simulated blackjack environment, focusing particularly on the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) for decision-making processes.

The traditional approach to blackjack strategy has been dominated by fixed rule-based systems, commonly known as "basic strategy." However, with the advent of advanced AI technologies, particularly LLMs, there is an opportunity to explore more dynamic and adaptive decision-making approaches. This study implements and compares three distinct types of players: a basic strategy player, a conservative AI player, and an aggressive AI player, with the latter two powered by LLM-based decision making.

## 2. System Model

The blackjack environment is implemented as a comprehensive simulation system with a game engine that manages core mechanics including card distribution, round management, bet handling, and win/loss determination. The system utilizes a standard 52-card deck with traditional blackjack rules and implements automatic deck shuffling when running low on cards.

The system implements three distinct types of AI agents. The Basic Strategy Agent employs rule-based decision making with fixed betting patterns based on chip count and implements traditional blackjack basic strategy. The Conservative LLM Agent focuses on risk-averse decision making and capital preservation, while the Aggressive LLM Agent employs high-risk decision making strategies focusing on maximizing potential returns. Both LLM agents utilize dynamic decision making through language model interactions.

## 3. Method

The prompt design for the LLM agents follows a comprehensive philosophy centered around context awareness and strategic direction. Each prompt includes the current game state, player's chip status, dealer's visible card, and complete hand information. The system embeds clear strategic direction through explicit risk-reward frameworks and decision constraints.

The prompt optimization process focused on clarity enhancement through explicit rule statements and clear decision boundaries. The system employs structured information presentation with priority-based decision factors and clear state representations. Response control is maintained through strict format requirements and validation mechanisms, ensuring consistent and valid decision outputs.

## 4. Experiment

The experiment was conducted across 40 rounds per game session with multiple parallel game sessions. All players started with 1000 chips while the dealer began with 5000 chips, ensuring consistent environment conditions across all agents. The experimental results revealed distinct patterns in agent performance and strategy effectiveness.

The Conservative AI demonstrated remarkable stability, maintaining chip counts between 950-1100 chips throughout the sessions. In contrast, the Aggressive AI showed high volatility, with chip counts ranging from 44 to 1410 chips. The Basic Strategy player demonstrated moderate stability, averaging between 800-900 chips.

The Conservative AI proved most effective at capital preservation, while the Aggressive AI showed potential for highest gains but also suffered severe losses. The Basic Strategy provided consistent but moderate performance, serving as a reliable benchmark for comparison.

## 5. Limitations and Conclusion

The study faced several technical constraints, including LLM response latency and potential API reliability issues. Strategic limitations included fixed personality traits throughout gameplay and limited adaptation to opponent patterns. The environment itself imposed constraints through its fixed rule set and simplified betting system.

The system implements three distinct types of AI agents:

1. Basic Strategy Agent:
   - Rule-based decision making
   - Fixed betting patterns based on chip count
   - Implements traditional blackjack basic strategy

2. Conservative LLM Agent:
   - Risk-averse decision making

   - Utilizes LLM for dynamic decision making

3. Aggressive LLM Agent:
   - High-risk decision making
